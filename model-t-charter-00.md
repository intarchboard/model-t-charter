# Draft charter for an IAB programme on the Internet trust model (model-t)
Stephen, 20191220; Jari, 20200108

RFC3552/BCP72 describes the trust model that has been used in Internet protocol
design. Since that was written however, the world has changed in terms of the
threats experienced and in terms of how protocol endpoints are implemented and
deployed.  It is therefore timely to re-consider the threat model used in the
design of IETF protocols, and there appears to be sufficient interest in doing
so to justify an IAB programme on this topic.

The model-t programme provides an open venue for analysis of the Internet threat
model and has as a goal to produce a potential update to BCP72 that defines an
Internet threat model that better matches today's reality. 

The potential update to BCP72 would be text offered to the IETF for
consideration - it is not within the IAB's remit, nor that of an IAB programme,
to directly modify a BCP. Nonetheless, an IAB programme offers a good venue for
this work, as it perhaps allows for more focus on the evolving
architecture aspect within this space., compared to an IETF working group that aims to meet more specific
milestones.

Updating BCP72 requires text that can be used by anyone developing an IETF
specification. This imposes significant constraints on that text in terms of
length, simplicity and the background knowledge required for the text to
produce useful results.  The programme is there also likely to produce other
documents (as RFCs or otherwise) that motivate or provide background materials
to justify or further elucidate the proposed update to BCP72. Those background
documents don't have to adhere to the same constraints as an update to BCP72.

There is relatively broad agreement that role and trust for different
endpoints in a protocol exchange is an important consideration, and
one worth better taking into account.  In specific cases there may be
different perspectives on the different tradeoffs involved, e.g., to
what extent privacy, information centralisation, or the roles of
enterprise networks should be considered as the highest priority.  And
no doubt, other equally valid perspectives exist. The model-t
programme is not a venue for attempting to determine the one true
perspective from which to tackle specific priorities. Our hope is that
there is sufficient overlap in the conclusions one would reach, such
that general guidance for considering these issues in an updated BCP72
is worthwhile.

Participants of the program are drawn from the IAB and the rest of the
community. Participation in this program is open to all interested
parties, and considered analysis of diverse inputs is important. The
IAB selects chairs for the program that are expected to facilitate
discussions. Specific individuals may be invited to participate on
particular topics from time to time based on their expertise without
needing to provide a long-term commitment.

Work is carried out on the model-t@iab.org mailing list that is open to any
subscriber.  Virtual meetings of the program are
announced on the mailing list (currently one planned for February 14)
and physical meetings during an IETF meeting (currently one planned
for IETF-107) will be found from the IETF meeting agenda.

Expected outputs from the programmme include:

- Text to offer to the IETF as a possible update to BCP72
- RFCs and other documents analysing how BCP72 matches (or doesn't match)
  today's reality
- RFCs and other documents proposing, justifying and explaining new threat
  models  

The IAB intends seeks community feedback on this programme charter (but work
has already started informally) either on architecture-discuss@iab.org or via
this github repository.
